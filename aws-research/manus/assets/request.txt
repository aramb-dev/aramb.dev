Hello Manus,

I’m looking for advice and possibly help setting up a **self-hosted AI agent** (similar to Replit Ghostwriter, Vercel v0, or Cursor AI) on an **AWS EC2 instance**.  
I want it fully local (no third-party SaaS fees) but still convenient to use like cloud services.

Here’s exactly what I need:

---

**1. Instance Recommendation:**
- What EC2 instance type would you recommend for running AI models locally?  
  (I'm aiming to run models like those from Ollama or LocalGPT.)
- Ideally, I want a good balance between GPU power, RAM, and cost.

---

**2. Deployment:**
- I want to install either **Ollama** or **LocalGPT** on the instance.
- It should auto-install everything necessary (Docker if needed, NVIDIA drivers, Ollama itself, etc.).
- A full **setup script** would be appreciated.

---

**3. Server Configuration:**
- I want to configure **Nginx** to serve the AI app cleanly at a domain (or IP) with proxying and basic security headers.
- Also, if possible, easy SSL (Let's Encrypt Certbot).

---

**4. Auto-start & Reliability:**
- The Ollama/LocalGPT service should **auto-start** if the EC2 instance reboots (via systemd, docker-compose, crontab, or your suggestion).

---

**5. Remote Development (VSCode in Browser):**
- I'd like to install something like **Code-Server** (VSCode via browser) so I can manage the server and code remotely through a browser.

---

**6. Cost Management (Auto Shutdown):**
- I want an **auto-shutdown script** that will **stop the EC2 instance** during non-usage hours (e.g., 2 AM every day) to save costs.
- (Preferably via cron or AWS Lambda, but open to your suggestions.)

---

**7. Cost Estimate Sheet:**
- I'd appreciate a rough **cost estimate** per month for running this setup (assuming moderate use, with and without GPU).
- Please include estimates for:
  - Instance cost
  - Storage cost
  - Data transfer (if significant)

---

# Why I'm Doing This:
I want to avoid paying subscription fees to Replit, Vercel, Cursor, etc. by hosting my own developer AI locally on a powerful cloud machine.  
However, I still want it easy to access, cleanly served, and cost-effective.

---

Please let me know:
- What you recommend
- If you can provide the setup scripts
- And if you can help me optimize the instance and costs further.

Thank you so much in advance!

Best regards,  
Abdur-Rahman Bilal
